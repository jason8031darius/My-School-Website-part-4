 i have won the first prize in an inter school debate on environmental pollution, i would feel <br> very happy and my friends will appreciate me and i would feel proud to be a student of our school <br> . i would feel that i am encouraged to participate/take part or share my opinion in the debates held at our school. but i think i would not get such an golden oppurtunity as there are people who debate very well and more than me and i can not compete with them.

 <h4>Implemented online attendance management system</h4>
 <img src="attendance.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
<p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">1.accurity humans are prone to error is even if we provide them with supporting complicates the devices automated attendance management systems and should accurate time records and minimize the incredible and costly errors with manual drive entry this sacred data device helps to provide accurate platforms and payrole data. <br> 2.Attendance Management System is software developed for daily student attendance in schools, colleges and institutes. It facilitates to access the attendance information of a particular student in a particular class. The information is sorted by the operators, which will be provided by the teacher for a particular class. This system will also help in evaluating attendance eligibility criteria of a student. Since ages, attendance system has remained one of the most important systems for evaluating the working time of students in any college or school. In short, this project is used to mark the number of days present/absent in any academic year of students in a college, school etc. <br> 3. Overview:-
  Attendance Management…show more content…
  Moreover, these data can be accessed by anyone and even they can modify any important data.
  
 <br> 4.Proposed System 
    This Application is built for automating the processing of attendance.
  It also enhances the speed of the performing attendance task easily. It also generates periodic reports to keep a check on the students who are regular & who are not.
  A Faculty has to login to the system & then in the attendance option they have to select appropriate class, semester and subject. So this will display the list of the students who are eligible to appear in this session. So now the faculty has to just select the students name from the manual attendance sheet according to their roll number and then submit the sheet. This will add the selected students as present student in that particular session. <br> 5.
  This system is very useful to the office staff also because they can generate various types of reports and submit them to respective faculties also or also can be submitted to the College Coordinator.
  Office staff can also generate black list of students who have attendance less than 50% or80%. So this kind of various reports can be generated
  Characteristics of the proposed system....</p>
